**THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED - an revamped simulator (in Rust) is available [here](https://github.com/marceleng/queueing-network-simulator)**

To run an experiment:
 1. Edit fog_simulator.c to set the parameters
 2. Compile with make fog_sim
 3. Run your experiment: ./fog_simulator [lambda] [number_of_arrivals]
